Running Atomic Bomberman in low-memory configurations

Note: You should close all open programs in the 
      background before running Bomberman.

If you still experience performance hits while 
running in this mode do the following:

1) Go into the options menu and turn off music
   during gameplay.  Music in Bomberman is staged
   to the Hard Drive and then streamed off.  If
   you suffer VM (Virtual Memory) hits you should
   turn music off.
