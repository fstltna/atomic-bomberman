What is PSS ?
--------------
PSS stands for Play Sound Shell.  PSS integrates with 
Playsh.exe to play sound files in the .RSS or .RSM 
formats from Bomberman.

When you run PSS a file PSS.ini will be generated if 
one does not already exist.  This is a listing of 
all the sounds within the current directory as
cataloged by PSS.  



Using PSS
----------
Type PSS and press <enter/return>.  Use your up and down
arrow key's on your keyboard to highlight a file.  When
you have found the file that you wish you play press 
<enter/return> and the file will play.  


Indexing Files
---------------
If you want to index a file (give it a description) you
can press the <insert> key, then type in a short 
description.  Once you are finished press <enter/return>
to go back into selection mode.

Number Referencing Files
------------------------
You can use the <+> or <-> keys to increment / decrement
a number reference while highlighting a sound.  The range
is 1-5.  This is usefull if you want to tag a bunch of file
then <"GREP"> them out to a seperate file.

If you have grep you can get the files you tagged out as 
followes  "Grep :1: pss.ini >mylist.txt".  This will pipe
all sounds tagged as "1" to a file called mylist.txt.
