What is Playsh ?
----------------

Playsh is a small "Play Shell" to play audio files.

It recognizes .RAW and .22k files as being 8-bit mono files,
and it recognizes .RSS files as being 16-bit stereo files.

It plays the latter by mixing both left and right channels
and then dividing the samples by 256 to get it to a rough
estimate of 8-bit audio.  It is very crude and only intended
to assist in previewing sound samples.

Playsh will only work on IRQs 7 and under and only if the
BLASTER= variable has been set properly on your system.

Playsh is an 8-bit MS-DOS utility and is usually quite
happy to run with Win95, but is not actually aware of
Win95 or any of Win95's services.


When playing any file the first time it may 'glurch'.  You
should play the file again to get a better listen. :)

PlaySh should not be run alone and should always be ran 
through PSS.
