Information on adding your own animations to Atomic Bomberman.

Once you have built your custom animations withing FREDIT, it's 
time to put them into the game.

Where to start
--------------
In .\data\res you will find the following files:
Valuelst.res


In .\data\ani you will find the following files
Xplode(n).ani
walk.ani, etc.
master.ali


Add/Replace your new animation in the master.ali file.


Once you have done that load up the VALUELST.RES and search for the
following values.


Number of Death Animations:
105,(n)

Currently this is set to 24.  If you add a new death, it would now
be 25.  You should follow the naming convention within the xplode(n).ani
files to keep things simple.

Number of Cornerhead Animations:
If your animation is that of a character getting trapped, ready to die 
you will need to add that here.
330,(n)

Currently this is set to 13.  If you add a new cornerhead, it would now be 14.  
You should follow the naming convention within the corner(n).ani
files to keep things simple.

If you wish to change any of the other files, you should make backups, and
overwrite them with your new data.  It is not possible to specify different
walks,runs,throws,kicks, etc.



More Information
----------------
Each animation that is defined in the MASTER.ALI file adds more to the
memory footprint of the game.  While is is not out of the question
to add in 50 deaths, it may not be worth your while to have them
all in the game.  Adjust your MASTER.ALI file and Valuelst.res file
to suit your needs.
