Information on how to add your own level('s) to Atomic Bomberman.


Note: You will need to become familiar with Fredit before adding
      your own stage into Bomberman.

Where to start
--------------
In .\data\res you will find the following files:
FIELD(n).pcx
Valuelst.res

In .\data\ani you will find the following files
XBRICK(n).ani
TILES(n).ani



The Palette
-----------
In your .\tools folder you will find a file called 
BOMBPAL.PCX.  You should use this palette whenever making 
your own custom graphics.  Bomberman will attempt to remap the 
screens as necessary, however, the end result may not always
be desirable.  Save yourself the trouble and use the palette
provided.


****** CREATING YOUR ASSETS *******
The Field
---------
The backgrounds are labeled FieldX.PCX where X is = to a number.
The last one in the list is FIELD10.PCX.  Unless you want to 
overwrite an existing stage you should probably start at 11 and 
work your way up.  Currently there are 11 files, starting at 0
and ending at 10.

Each FIELDX.pcx is a 640x480 PCX file in 256 colors.  I strongly 
suggest that you use one of the existing files as a template to 
make sure you get the layout the right way.

Once you have created your new field, name it appropriately 
(Field11.pcx) in this case and copy it into your .\data\res
directory.


The Tiles
---------
Located in: .\data\ani
The Tiles are labeled TILESX.ANI where X is = to a number.
The last one in the list is TILES10.ANI.  Unless you want to 
overwrite an existing TILE SET you should probably start at 11 and 
work your way up.  Currently there are 11 files, starting at 0
and ending at 10.

Each TILESX.ANI is a fredit animation file. (see details on using 
fredit).  

Once you have created your new TILES file, name it appropriately 
TILES11.ANI in this case and copy it into your .\data\ani
directory.

You should use one of the TILESX.ANI files as reference.  You will
notice after loading one of these files that one is a destructible
barrier, and one is non-destructible.

These should be named appropriately within Fredit as well when 
defined as a sequence.

TILE X BRICK (Where X is = to the number)
TILE X SOLID 


The Bricks
----------
Located in: .\data\ani
The Tiles are labeled XBRICKX.ANI where X is = to a number.
The last one in the list is XBRICK10.ANI.  Unless you want to 
overwrite an existing BRICK SET you should probably start at 11 and 
work your way up.  Currently there are 11 files, starting at 0
and ending at 10.

Each XBRICKX.ANI is a fredit animation file. (see details on using 
fredit).  

Once you have created your new BRICKS file, name it appropriately 
XBRICK11.ANI in this case and copy it into your .\data\ani
directory.

You should use one of the XBRICKX.ANI files as reference.  You will
notice after loading one of these files that there is a sequence of
a destructible brick blowing up.  This should be 9 or 10 frames, no
more no less.

These should be named appropriately within Fredit as well when 
defined as a sequence.

FLAME BRICK X  (Where X is = to the number)


-------------------
Now that you have all your data prepared your now ready to add your 
new arena/stage into the game.

******** ADDING YOUR STAGE TO THE GAME ********
Modifying the VALUELST.RES file to get your stage into the game.

WARNING: YOU MUST DO ALL OF THESE STEPS.  It is possible for bad things
to happen if you do not.  Make sure you do not overrun any value into another.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have your stage data in the right place you will need to load 
up the file VALUELST.RES in your .data\res directory with 'notepad'.
Search down until you find value 35 (How many levels are defined),
and then add 1 to it.  By default this is 11, when adding a 
stage just change/increment the number following the comma by 1.
For Example:
35,11  (before)
35,12  (after)


=====Regenerating Tiles
Now you will need to look for the value 340 - 350
and add in another reference number here. 
351,(n) for example.
This will determine if the level has regenerating tiles or not.



=====Ice Delays
Now you will need to look for the value 450 - 460
and add in another reference number here.
461,(n) for example.

This will determine the Ice Delay if any for your level.



=====Random Level ?
Now you will need to look for the value 1150 - 1161
and add in another reference number here.  
1162,(n) for example.

This will determine if this arena is chosen during random
selection.


In the root of your Bomberman folder you will find a file called
MESSAGES.TXT.  You will need to find the value 150 - 160
and add in another reference number here.
161,My first level

This will name your level for use within the game.


The Master Animation List
-------------------------
Now that you have your FIELD, XBRICK, and TILES made for your stage,
including your modified VALUELST.RES file, all you need to do is load
up the following file.  MASTER.ALI located in .\data\ani.  Locate
the section -xbrickX.ani and -tilesX.ani and add in your new levels
appropriately.

More Information
----------------
Each level that is defined in the MASTER.ALI file adds more to the
memory footprint of the game.  While is is not out of the question
to add in 50 levels, it may not be worth your while to have them
all in there.  Adjust your MASTER.ALI file and Valuelst.res file
to suit your needs.
