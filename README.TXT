1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bomberman requires the following minimum system 
configuration:
  - IBM PC or 100% compatible Pentium(TM) 90 or
    faster
  - Windows(R) 95 
  - 16mb RAM
  - CD-ROM drive
  - Sound Blaster(TM) or 100% compatible 
    sound card
  - 40mb free hard drive space
  - Mouse
  - DirectX(TM) 3.0+


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!!!IMPORTANT!!!
In order to install Atomic Bomberman you will need 
to have 'DIRECTX' previously installed on your machine.

If you do not have DirectX installed, you can install it
from the 'AutoRun' by clicking on 'Install DirectX'.

!!!WARNING!!!
It is not recommended to use long filenames and or names
with spaces for the install path.  It's advisable to 
keep folder names to 8 characters or less.

If you have Autorun activated, the Autorun window will 
pop up upon inserting your Atomic Bomberman CD into 
your CD-ROM drive.  Click on the "INSTALL" button to 
install Bomberman.

If you do not have Autorun active, select your CD-ROM 
drive and double-click the AUTORUN.EXE on the 
Atomic Bomberman CD.  A window should pop up where
you can click the "INSTALL" to install Bomberman.

There are 3 installation types for Atomic Bomberman:

Minimal (MIN): Installs all the necessary game files 
  with the exception of Music, Sfx, and Voices.  The 
  CD will be required since all sounds are loaded off 
  of the CD.

Medium (MED): Installs the game files including music.  
  Sfx and Voices are not copied to the hard drive so 
  the CD will be required to load these files.

Maximum (MAX): This installs EVERYTHING.  The CD is 
  not required.

It is recommended that you use the MED or MAX installs 
for optimum performance. 

If you do not see any available drives in your list you
will need to free up more disk space and or choose a
different installation type. If a drive is not selected
the installation will fail.  


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. Playing the game		
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To begin your Atomic Bomberman experience, click on 
'Play' from your Autorun window.  Otherwise, go to 
your 'Start Menu' and select Atomic Bomberman 
shortcut within the 'Interplay' folder to launch 
the game.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. Trouble Shooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Windows NT:  
	Atomic Bomberman is a Windows 95 application.  
	It may run under Windows NT, if DirectX is 
	fully installed and functioning properly.

* DINPUT.DLL not found:
	You will need to install DirectX.  The install 
	files for DirectX are located on your Bomberman 
	CD.  Run DXSETUP.EXE under the DirectX folder.

* Music on menu's seems to play at double speed:
	This seems to be a conflict with your normal 
	audio driver and the certified DirectX 
	components.  You will have to do one of three 
	things. 

	1) Restore your audio drivers.
	2) Reinstall DirectX audio drivers.
	3) Remove all audio drivers and reinstall, 
		along with DirectX.

	Another possible solution is to check your 
	Virtual Memory settings.  Bomberman streams 
	the music off of the hard drive and certain
	setting's may effect the music stream.

* When starting a new game, the frame rate appears to drop:
	This is a side-effect of caching in the audio for
        a new game.  This should only happen on the first 
        game after booting into Bomberman.  This will also
        happen on the first game after sound is flushed from
        memory.  You will be notified when sound is being 
        flushed before an actual game starts.

	Another solution is to do the following:
		A) Go into the following folder .\data\res and
		   load up VALUELST.RES with any text editor.
		B) Locate the value 4,0 at the top of the file
                   and change it to 4,1.
		C) Save and exit.
 	This will now pre-load all the sounds when booting 
	Bomberman.  
	
	!!!WARNING!!! 
	Do not modify any other values in this file without 
	making a backup.  If you do Bomberman may cease to 
	function properly.
